# Project: LINE Bot RPG

## Directory Overview

This directory contains the design specification for a LINE Bot-based RPG game. The core of the project is the `spec.md` file, which outlines the game's mechanics, features, and overall concept.

This project is currently in the design phase. There is no source code yet.

## Key Files

*   **`spec.md`**: The core design document for the LINE Bot RPG. It outlines game mechanics like registration, combat, crafting, and quests. This file serves as the foundational knowledge for the project.

## Development

### Next Steps

The next step for this project is to start implementing the game based on the `spec.md`. Here are some suggestions for getting started:

1.  **Choose a Technology Stack:** Since this is a LINE Bot application, you will need a backend server to handle the bot's logic. Popular choices include:
    *   **Node.js:** with the `@line/bot-sdk` library.
    *   **Python:** with the `line-bot-sdk` library.
    *   **Go:** with the `line-bot-sdk-go` library.

2.  **Set up a LINE Developers Account:** You will need to create a LINE Developers account and a new "Messaging API" channel to get the necessary credentials (Channel Access Token and Channel Secret) for your bot.

3.  **Implement the Core Features:** Start by implementing the core features described in `spec.md`, such as:
    *   Player registration (`註冊`).
    *   Combat system (`討伐`).
    *   Gathering and crafting systems (`探索`, `製作`).

### Running and Testing

Once the development has started, this section should be updated with instructions on how to build, run, and test the project.
